Python bindings to the OpenStack Compute API
============================================

This is a client for the OpenStack Compute API used by Rackspace Cloud and
others. There's :doc:`a Python API <api>` (the :mod:`openstack.compute`
module), and a :doc:`command-line script <shell>` (installed as
:program:`openstack-compute`). Each implements the entire OpenStack Compute
API (as well as a few Rackspace-only addons).

To try this out, you'll need a `Rackspace Cloud`__ account â€” or your own
install of OpenStack Compute (also known as Nova). If you're using Rackspace
you'll need to make sure to sign up for both Cloud Servers *and* Cloud Files
-- Rackspace won't let you get an API key unless you've got a Cloud Files
account, too. Once you've got an account, you'll find your API key in the
management console under "Your Account".

    You may want to read `Rackspace's API guide`__ (PDF) -- the first bit, at
    least -- to get an idea of the concepts. Rackspace/OpenStack is doing the
    cloud hosting thing a bit differently from Amazon, and if you get the
    concepts this library should make more sense.
